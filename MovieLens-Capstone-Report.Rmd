# Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts movie ratings.  
Performance is measured using RMSE and tested once on `final_holdout_test`.

# Final RMSE

```{r}
final_rmse <- 0.864817
final_rmse
```

# Conclusion

The final regularized model reached an RMSE of `r final_rmse`.  
This result meets the target set by the edX Capstone Project instructions.
