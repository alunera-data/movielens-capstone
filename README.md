# üé¨ MovieLens Capstone Project

This project is part of the final capstone for the **HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate** on edX.

---

## üéØ Goal

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for movie ratings using the **MovieLens 10M dataset**.  
The model performance is evaluated using the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** metric, in accordance with the project instructions.

All models are trained using the `edx` dataset.  
The `final_holdout_test` dataset is used **only once** to evaluate the final model.

## üìö Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the [MovieLens 10M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/),  
provided by [GroupLens Research](https://grouplens.org/). It is licensed for research and educational use.

üìå **Note:** The dataset is **not included in this repository**.  
You can download it manually at:

## üß† Modeling Approach

The predictive modeling follows an incremental development approach:

1. **Baseline Model (Global Mean):**  
   Predicts the same average rating for all movies (RMSE ~1.06).

2. **Movie Effect Model:**  
   Adjusts predictions based on each movie's average deviation (RMSE improved).

3. **User Effect Model (upcoming):**  
   Will account for how individual users tend to rate compared to the mean.

Planned extensions include:
- Regularization
- Cross-validation
- Time and genre effects

Each step includes a performance evaluation using RMSE.
